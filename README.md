# Autonomous Parking PiCar

This repository contains the code for an autonomous parking system implemented on the SunFounder PiCar-X. The project aims to demonstrate the use of sensors and computer vision techniques to enable the PiCar-X to detect parking spaces and maneuver into them automatically.

## Features

- Real-time parking space detection using the onboard camera.
- Automated steering control for parking maneuvers.
- Simple user interface for monitoring and interaction.
- Controlled environment testing with visual markers (blue tape).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- SunFounder PiCar-X kit assembled with a Raspberry Pi 4.
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module installed and enabled.
- Access to the Raspberry Pi via SSH or directly (monitor, keyboard, and mouse).
- Python 3.7+ installed on the Raspberry Pi.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/auto-park-car.git
cd auto-park-car
